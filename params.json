Thanks to the support of the unRAID community a number of fixes and improvements are introduced. See the file changes.md for a list of what has been changed, including changes in several optional plugins. All users of version 2.0.1 are encouraged to upgrade to this version.*\r\n\r\n\r\nDynamix webGui is a dynamic webGui for unRAID systems with enhanced features and optional add-ons.\r\n\r\nDynamix webGui is the next step in the evolution of the original SimpleFeatures enhanced webGui for unRAID systems.\r\nIts goal is to have pages dynamically updated and watch the operation of your unRAID server in real-time.\r\n\r\nDynamix webGui offers a number of improvements not available before:\r\n\r\n- Real-time page updates, the status view of your array is always up-to-date.\r\n- Tabbed viewing, more efficient use of the available screen area, scrolling is hardly required.\r\n- Improved visibility, better readibility and consistency of the sans-serif and monospace fonts in different browsers.\r\n- Improved operability, no more accidental cancellations or wrong button clicking.\r\n- Fully compatible with unRAID OS v5.0.\r\n\r\n#### Introduction\r\n\r\nDynamix webGui completely replaces the stock unRAID GUI which comes with version 5.0, do **not** use Dynamix webGui on any earlier versions - including the earlier RC candidates of unRAID.\r\n\r\nDo **not** mix Dynamix and SimpleFeatures plugins, these are not compatible.\r\n\r\nDynamix webGui requires an up-to-date browser version. It has been tested with the latest versions of Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox and Safari.\r\n\r\n#### Download warning\r\n\r\n*DO NOT DOWNLOAD FILES DIRECTLY FROM THE FOLDER 'DOWNLOAD' OR 'PLUGINS' BUT USE THE LINKS PROVIDED IN THIS 'README.MD' FILE INSTEAD. THE SAME IS TRUE FOR THE OPTIONAL PLUGINS - USE THE LINKS PROVIDED IN THE FILE 'OPTIONAL PLUGINS.MD'*\r\n\r\n#### Installation\r\n\r\n*This describes a first time installation, if you are upgrading from an older version, see the section 'Upgrading'.*\r\n\r\nDynamix webGui is considered a system plugin and is installed in the folder `/boot/plugins`.\r\nThis ensures it gets installed first, before any other plugins, and the correct environment is created upfront.\r\n\r\n- Login to the command line on your server, e.g., at the console or a telnet session.\r\n- Create the directory `/boot/plugins` directory, if it is not existing.\r\n- Type the below:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd /boot/plugins\r\nwget --no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/bergware/dynamix/master/plugins/dynamix.webGui-2.0.2-noarch-bergware.plg\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Alternatively: [![](/download/dynamix.webGui.png)](https://raw.github.com/bergware/dynamix/master/plugins/dynamix.webGui-2.0.2-noarch-bergware.plg) (right-click and select \"save link as\")\r\n\r\n- Reboot your server to start with a *clean* webGui environment.\r\n- You may need to clear your Browser's cache for correct viewing.\r\n\r\n#### Upgrading\r\n\r\nYou can upgrade to the latest version of [Dynamix webGui](https://raw.github.com/bergware/dynamix/master/plugins/dynamix.webGui-2.0.2-noarch-bergware.plg) (right-click and select \"save link as\")\r\n\r\nSave the file in `/boot/plugins` and type the below:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd /boot/plugins\r\nrm dynamix.webGui-2.0.1-noarch-bergware.plg\r\ninstallplg dynamix.webGui-2.0.2-noarch-bergware.plg\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Screenshots\r\n\r\nThe main screen shows the different devices in separate tabs. The current screen is updated in real-time. Click on the tab header to move between screens.\r\n\r\n![](/screenshots/main-array.png)\r\n\r\nThe operation of the array (e.g. parity-check) can be viewed in real-time as well. When a parity-check is ongoing the statusbar at the bottom shows the current status in any screen. Note also the disabling of buttons to avoid accidental mis-clicking!\r\n\r\n![](/screenshots/main-paritycheck.png)\r\n\r\nSettings are logically grouped. This not only removes the clutter of a busy screen, but makes it also easier to find your way.\r\n\r\n![](/screenshots/settings.png)\r\n\r\nMonospace font is made more readable, both for main screen and popup screens.\r\n\r\n![](/screenshots/system-log.png)\r\n\r\nThe Browser function has been rewritten for improved speed and visibility of duplicate files. These are clearly indicated by displaying them in orange.\r\n\r\n![](/screenshots/duplicates.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
